## About Me 
A recent graduate completed Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at Panimalar Institute Of Technology with a passion for coding and crafting innovative solutions. This README is my playground to showcase my journey, skills, and aspirations. Let's dive in!

### Skills & Interests:

- **Programming Languages**          : Core Java, Python
- **Web Technologies**               : HTML, CSS, JavaScript(basics)
- **Databases**                      : Postgresql
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**   : Structuring Information for efficiency
- **Developer Tools**                : Github, Eclipse, VS Code, Power BI
- **Academic Coursework**            : DSA, OOPS, DBMS
- **Interests**                      : Web and software Development

### Projects:
- **Machine Learning Enhanced Intrusion Detection For Cybersecurity** : The Intrusion Detection Model helps to identify the network traffic and distinguish whether the activity of the network is normal or abnormal. It detects and provide solution even when it is zero day attack. The project development process involves various step including collecting a raw dataset , preprocessing the data into structured format, data visualization is done for analysis of attack type and to find the accuracy of attacks, implemented and trained the model with three different algorithm - GNB, Adabooster, Extratree classifier to classify and to find the greater accuracy of attacks.The accuracy dataset is stored in pkl format. Later a webpage is developed for user interaction, to find what type of attack is detected and how to prevent it and precautions will be provided for user.[Project Link](https://github.com/KavyaPS/Machine-Learning-Enhanced-Intrusion-Detection-For-Cybersecurity)
- **Climate Analysis Dashboard - Built using Power BI**: Developed a insightful dashboard to predict and analyse the condition of weather.Focused on analyzing large datasets by applying data cleaning,preprocessing, and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
using PostgreSQL.Structured and transformed the data, uploading them to Power BI to create an interactive and
insightful dashboard with Python-based visualizations.[Project Link](https://github.com/KavyaPS/Climate-Analysis-Dashboard)

- **SMART DOOR LOCK WITH BLUETOOTH - Built Using Embedded And IOT.**: Developed a Bluetooth-enabled smart door lock system using Arduino, demonstrating expertise in embedded systems
and IoT integration.Coded Arduino functionality using Arduino IDE to handle the locking mechanism.Enabled lock
and unlock operations via mobile devices using Bluetooth connectivity.[Project Link](https://github.com/KavyaPS/Smart-Door-Lock-with-Bluetooth)
